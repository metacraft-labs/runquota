# Windows monitored daemon readiness and retention miss fixture deadlines

Status: open. Observed at RunQuota `177e2af` with io-mon `5421a9b`.

## Observed

Ordinary Windows x64 job
[109548617510](https://github.com/metacraft-labs/runquota/actions/runs/36609966396/job/109548617510)
fails two programs. The forced-supervisor-kill case cannot connect to its newly
started daemon within the existing four-second readiness bound; the other
seven lease lifecycle cases pass. Scheduled retention reports no completed
sweep within its twenty-second wait, and the healthy-store precondition of
the unwritable-store case removes no rows within ten seconds. Another retention
case records a 28.229-second prune window and passes concurrent admission and
observation assertions. After daemon shutdown the first case finds the correct
retained rows, so absence of pruning is not established by its timeout alone.

## Expected and investigation

[RunQuota Observation Store](../../reprobuild-specs/RunQuota-Observation-Store.md)
requires background retention without blocking admission. The
[release validation spec](../../metacraft-specs/infrastructure/gosti-io-mon-runquota-releases.md)
requires real daemon tests in both ordinary paths. Preserve those assertions
and deadlines while comparing the same binaries without monitoring. Capture
retention state and child startup evidence before choosing a runtime or fixture
repair. Current evidence does not separate monitor overhead, competing fixture
work, or a daemon defect. Shared diagnostic `d04a676` compares the selected
programs in `36618038706` and reports the retention state at each failure.

Refreshed dev `e9f9011` and searched open and deleted readiness/retention issues.
The earlier Windows tool-store issue records a startup timeout but no isolated
cause. macOS sentinel readiness concerns a different child and measurement.
