# Database Posture

RunQuota maintains two kinds of durable state, with different maturity.

## Learned resource estimates

Estimates keyed by the opaque command stats id, used for admission and OOM
prevention. Held in memory on the hot path (O(1) lookup) and flushed
asynchronously to SQLite. This is scheduler metadata only and MUST NOT affect
cache identity.

## Observation store

RunQuota is the system of record for program-execution observations: one durable,
immutable row per executed process, with host and versioned hardware identity,
resource peaks, ambient host load, and product-specific facts in extension tables.

The normative specification — schema, extension mechanism, retention, cross-host
merge, redaction, and the write path — is
`reprobuild-specs/RunQuota-Observation-Store.md`. The shared-memory transport that
carries observations off the hot path is
`reprobuild-specs/RunQuota-Shared-Memory-Transport.md`.

Both Reprobuild and the CodeTracer test runner are clients of this store. See
`codetracer-specs/Planned-Features/Nim-Parallel-Test-Framework.md` §17 for the
test-side reporter.

Note the daemon boundary in `CLAUDE.md`: `runquotad` is a lease authority and does
not monitor client process trees. Per-execution resource figures are therefore
**client-reported**, as they already are for learned estimates; the daemon samples
only host-wide totals and derives foreign load by difference.

## State-boundary requirements

Any persistent RunQuota state must document schema ownership, migrations, backup,
restore, corruption handling, and benchmarks before it becomes a stable boundary.
For the observation store these are specified in
`reprobuild-specs/RunQuota-Observation-Store.md` §"State-Boundary Requirements".

Two rules apply to every persistent store here:

- A corrupt or unavailable store degrades to no capture. It MUST NOT fail a build
  or a test run.
- The daemon MUST refuse to open a database newer than it understands rather than
  degrade silently.

## JSON

JSON may be emitted for inspection output, diagnostics, or benchmark reports. It
MUST NOT define persistent or wire state.
